# 1. Define your goal.

Before you start visualizing your data or making a dashboard, make sure you can clearly explain what your goal is. In most cases, you probably donâ€™t want to make a data visualization just for the sake of it. Some questions to consider before you start designing your viz include:

* What questions do you want to answer?
* Why do you want to make a data visualization or dashboard?
* What purpose will your viz or dashboard serve?
* What is your goal?
