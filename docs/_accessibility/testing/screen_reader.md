# Test your visualization or dashboard with a screen reader.

Screen readers are software programs that convert digital text into synthesized speech. They empower users to hear content and navigate with a keyboard. For an overview of screen readers, see WebAIMâ€™s article [Designing for Screen Reader Compatibility](https://webaim.org/techniques/screenreader/){:target="_blank"}. 

Some popular screen readers include:

* [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/_1121.html){:target="_blank"} (for Mac)
