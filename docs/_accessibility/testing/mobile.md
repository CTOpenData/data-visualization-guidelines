# Test on mobile 

Once you have a draft of your data visualization or dashboard, test it from your phone to see how it works on mobile. Can you see the key information? Can you navigate any interactive elements? 

In some tools like Power BI or Tableau, you may want to develop separate view for mobile and desktop. For more guidance on developing dashboards for mobile, see DataSFâ€™s [Public Data Visualization Guide](https://datasf.gitbook.io/public-data-visualization-guide/mobile-view){:target="_blank"}.
