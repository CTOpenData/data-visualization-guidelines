# Ensure the keyboard focus indicator is easily visible.

When a user is navigating a website using a keyboard, they typically use the tab key to navigate interactive elements such as links, buttons, fields, etc. As they tab through the items on the site, the selected item that is tabbed to has keyboard “focus” and can be activated or manipulated with the keyboard. 

Focus indicators are automatically provided by web browsers and usually appear as a border or outline around the focused elements. When you test your data visualization or dashboard with a keyboard, ensure that the focus indicator is easily visible. 

If your page includes custom html and css, make sure that the focus indicator is included and works as expected. For more information about focus indicators, see the focus indicator section of WebAIM’s article [Keyboard Accessibility](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/){:target="_blank"}.
