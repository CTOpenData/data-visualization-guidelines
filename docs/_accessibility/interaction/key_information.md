# Don’t require interactions to access key information.

No interactions or clicks should be required to see critical information in your visualization. Try to set up your visualization so that the important conclusion is obvious by default, without any clicking needed. Similarly, don’t rely on tooltips to convey important information, as they can challenging for users with some motor issues. If you use tooltips, verify they contain clear information and that information is also available in text or an aria label. Tooltips are not typically accessible to screen readers.
