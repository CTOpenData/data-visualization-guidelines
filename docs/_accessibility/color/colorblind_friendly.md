# Choose colors that are accessible and colorblind friendly. 

When choosing a color palette for your data visualization, check that your color combinations are accessible to people with colorblindness (approximately 8% of men and 0.5% of women). Some common problematic color combinations include red/green, green/brown, green/blue, and blue/gray. 

Color combinations are not just important for those with colorblindness but for everyone since they help users clearly understand the data being presented visually.

You may want to use the colors suggested in the [Connecticut Logo Guidelines](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/DECD/Tourism/CT-Brand-2023/CT-DECD-LOGO-GUIDELINES-110223.pdf){:target="_blank"} (p. 17-23), or it may be helpful to develop a color palette for your team to promote consistency and to ensure that your work is accessible.
