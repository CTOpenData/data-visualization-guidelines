# Ensure text is readable.

Consider the font size, typeface, use of color, and spacing to make sure that your text can be read easily. [HighCharts](https://www.highcharts.com/blog/tutorials/10-guidelines-for-dataviz-accessibility/){:target="_blank"} makes the following recommendations for accessible text: 
	
* Avoid small text, which is generally harder to read. Consider using common abbreviations to allow for larger text. 
* Make sure text has sufficient contrast against its background. 
* Use sans serif fonts, which tend to have better readability, especially for people with dyslexia. Recommended accessible fonts include Verdana and Helvetica. 
* Avoid using cursive or italic font styles. 
* Check the line spacing and word spacing to make sure text is not too crowded.
