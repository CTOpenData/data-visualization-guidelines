# Introduction 

These guidelines highlight best practices for creating clear and accessible data visualizations. They include guidance on the data visualization process, tools, and accessibility best practices. These guidelines were developed for Connecticut state employees who want to visualize their data. They are maintained by the [Data and Policy Analytics](https://portal.ct.gov/datapolicy/){:target="_blank"} team at the CT Office of Policy and Management.

## What is data visualization? 

Data visualization is the representation of information and data in a visual format such as charts, graphs, maps, etc. Data visualization makes it easier for people to quickly understand complex ideas in data and can give us a quick "at-a-glance" understanding of trends or patterns.

In state government, we often use data visualization in reports, slides, and dashboards to highlight points or trends in our data for informational and decision-making purposes. Good data visualization should help people find insights and make discoveries about data. Poor data visualization can confuse, mislead, or make it difficult for people to use them effectively. 

These guidelines outline the steps we can take to design clear and informative data visualizations that are accessible to everybody. 

## What is accessibility? 

Accessibility (also referred to as a11y) is the practice of making your content usable by as many people as possible. [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility){:target="_blank"} adds: "You might also think of accessibility as treating everyone the same, and giving them equal opportunities, no matter what their ability or circumstances."

Federally-funded agencies are required to make their content accessible to people with disabilities. In the U.S. 26% of adults have some type of disability, with about 19% of adults in Connecticut having a disability.[^1]

We should all prioritize accessibility from the start of our data visualization process and should consider hearing, motor, cognitive, and visual accessibility. Use these guidelines as a starting place for designing accessible data visualizations. 

## How to use these guidelines 

These guidelines include a high-level overview of the steps for designing data visualizations, as well as more detailed guidance on accessibility and equity in data visualization. The sections are outlined below as well as in the navigation panel to the left.

### Data visualization steps
1. [Define your goal](data-visualization-steps\1_define_your_goal)
2. [Know your audience](data-visualization-steps\2_know_your_audience)
3. [Identify and prioritize the data points or trends you want to highlight](data-visualization-steps\3_identify_data_to_highlight)
4. [Match your story with a chart type](data-visualization-steps\4_choose_chart_type)
5. [Choose a software program](data-visualization-steps\5_choose_software_program)
6. [Design your visualization](data-visualization-steps\6_design)

### Accessibility 
#### [Data](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/data/data_intro)
1. [Provide access to the data in an accessible table format](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/data/table_format)
2. [Use data visualizations that are familiar to viewers](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/data/familiar_visualizations)

#### [Color](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/color/color_intro)
1. [Avoid relying on color as the only way to convey information](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/color/color_alone)
2. [Ensure that there is sufficient contrast between colors used in your data visualization or dashboard](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/color/color_contrast)
3. [Choose colors that are accessible and colorblind friendly](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/color/colorblind_friendly)
4. [Use white space](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/color/white_space)

#### [Text](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/text/text_intro)
1. [Provide a text-based equivalent for every data visualization](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/text/text_equivalent)
2. [Use alternative text (alt text) to describe all non-decorative visuals](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/text/alt_text)
3. [Use plain language](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/text/plain_language)
4. [Ensure text is readable](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/text/readable_text)
5. [Create meaningful labels and titles](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/text/labels_and_titles)

#### [Interaction](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/interaction/interaction_intro)
1. [Make interactive visualizations keyboard-accessible](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/interaction/keyboard)
2. [Ensure the keyboard focus indicator is easily visible](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/interaction/focus_indicator)
3. [Check that the tab order is logical and intuitive for keyboard and assistive technology users](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/interaction/tab_order)
4. [Don’t require interactions to access key information](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/interaction/key_information)

#### [Testing](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/testing/testing_intro)
1. [Test your visualization or dashboard with a screen reader](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/testing/screen_reader)
2. [Test for low vision](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/testing/low_vision)
3. [Test on mobile](/data-visualization-guidelines/accessibility/testing/mobile)
