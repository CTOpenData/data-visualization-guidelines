# Use data visualizations that are familiar to viewers. 

Choose simple, familiar visualizations instead of complicated graphs, which can be hard for people to understand. For people with certain cognitive impairments, complex visualizations can be especially challenging. 

If you find your visualization becoming overly complex, consider a different chart type, or break your chart into multiple less complicated charts. A helpful resource for guidance on what chart type to use is [From Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

If you do choose a more complicated visualization, it is especially important to provide a text description of the visualization to help users understand how to interpret it.
